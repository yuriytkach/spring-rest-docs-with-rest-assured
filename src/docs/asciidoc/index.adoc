- If the input contains and id that is greater than zero, then response returned with valid status and input is duplicated
- If the input contains id that is zero or less, or missing and id, then response returned with invalid status and input is duplicated

== HTTP status codes
*Sample Rest Service* tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.
